I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Rochester (URoch) majoring in Computer Science (BS) and Mathematics & Statistics (BA). I am currently working with [Chenliang Xu](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~cxu22/) at URoch and [Thomas Serre](https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/person/thomas-serre/) at Brown. 

My current research focuses on: (1) multimodality learning in vision and sound, (2) leveraging weakly supervised signals in cancer classifications.
